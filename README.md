In this project, I had made an ATM application with the help of a GUI library 'Swing' of JAVA and had done operations like Deposit, Withdrawal, Fast Cash, etc but with GUI. 
I had made this pages using JFrame Form which is used to make GUI form pages in Swing.
This was a mini frontend project so we haven't used any Database.
Instead we passed values from one jframe to another using constructors.
So, the data is not stored anywhere and is passed from one frame to another.
Because of this whenever we open the project we are using the new data because the data is not stored in the database.
